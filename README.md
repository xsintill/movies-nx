# movies-nx

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev) and built with [SvelteJs](https://svelte.dev/) and [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) and written in typescript.

The webapp shows a list of the latest movies seen. All movies show a poster, synopsis, tmdb rating, etc. Data is retrieved from a local sql server database. The app talks to a tmdb service which needs an api key.
